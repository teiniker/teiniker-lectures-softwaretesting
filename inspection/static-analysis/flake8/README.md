# Flake8

Flake8 is a wrapper around **PyFlakes**, **pycodestyle**,
and Ned Batchelderâ€™s **McCabe script**.

It focuses on **style enforcement following PEP 8**, **error detection**
(via PyFlakes), and **cyclomatic complexity** (via McCabe script).

Flake8 is often considered more lightweight compared to PyLint and is
used for catching errors and enforcing style guide consistency.

## Setup

To install Flake8, we can use the `pip` command:
```
$ pip3 install flake8
```

## Command Line Usage

```
Usage: $ flake8 <path>
```
