# Load Testing

Load testing is a type of **performance testing used to evaluate how a web
service or web application behaves under a specific load**.

The main objective of load testing is to determine the system's performance
in terms of responsiveness and stability when subjected to normal and peak load
conditions.

Key aspects and benefits of load testing:

* **Simulating User Traffic**: Load testing involves simulating multiple
    users accessing the web service or application simultaneously. This
    helps in understanding how the system handles concurrent

* **Performance Metrics**: During load testing, various performance metrics
    are collected, such as response time, throughput, error rates, and resource
    utilization (CPU, memory, disk, and network).

* **Scalability Assessment**: Load testing helps in assessing the scalability
    of the application. It identifies the maximum number of users or requests
    the system can handle before performance degrades.

* **Identifying Bottlenecks**: By applying a controlled load, load testing helps
    identify performance bottlenecks in the application. These could be related
    to the server, database, network, or application code.

Load testing is a critical practice for web services and web applications,
ensuring they can handle the expected load while maintaining performance,
scalability, and reliability.
